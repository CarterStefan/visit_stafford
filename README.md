# VISIT STAFFORD

This is my second milestone project towards my full-stack web developer course with the Code Institute. 

"I will create a website for my hometown of Stafford. This will feature information about the town, images of the area, along with a map feature showing places to eat as well as local attractions. I also plan to incorparate a weather forecast feature to update people who may be planning a visit what the weather will be like in the town."

The main user of the website will be residents who live here looking for something to do, as well as people who have never been to the town before who may be planning a visit.

## UX
 
The users of this website can be split into two simple groups, those who live in Stafford and those who don't. The aim of the website will be to inform people of what there is to do around stafford. This will include places to eat and drink, places of interest to visit, and places to shop. Due to this, despite the two groups of users being split, they share a common purpose to visit the site in the fact they are looking for something to do in Stafford.

The website will be focused on adults, so will need a professional and clean feel to the site, encouraging people to visit the area. It should be informative and easy to use.

### User Stories

- I am a current resident of stafford looking for somewhere to eat this weekend. 

  Having lived here for a few years, I do know of the restaurants here, although I am unable to choose which one to go to for a meal out on the weekend.  
  I would like to go on a website to show me a list of local eateries, so I can see them all in one place to see which one takes my fancy the most, and       perhaps find a restaurant I did not know about near to me. 
  
  
- I am visiting Stafford on part of a business trip having never been to the town before. 

  As part of my expenses from work, I get a meal and drink included for each night. Not wanting to eat in the hotel room, I am looking for somewhere to eat   and find out a little about the town. As well as food, I would like to see more of the town than just the office and hotel room, so I would benefit from   suggestions of local places to walk and attractions to see in my free time while I am here.
  
  
- I am visiting Stafford for a wedding on Sunday. I will be staying from Friday - Monday. 

  I would like to see what there is to do around the town on the days leading up to the wedding. Also, I would like to know what I need to pack in my         suitcase for the weekend. I want to know if I will need warm weathered clothing or cold weathered clothing for the days either side of the wedding.
  
  
## Features

This is a one page website. I opted for this as I wanted the page to be a one stop place for all information, which I felt a multi page wesbite would take away this concept. The webpage consists of:

- Jumbotron - Stand-out picture and "Welcome to Stafford Tagline".

- Introcution - A short introduction about the town.

- What's on - This section features a small selection of places to eat / see and stay. Each of these items offers an external link ot the website, or the option to view on the map.

- Map controls - There is also some additonal buttons which will have added control for the map. This includes show all of one category, show all of all categories and clear the map.

- Map - This is where the above controls are visualised. Once markers appear on the map, they can be clicked to show info windows with another link to the website.

- Weather - This section of the website is linked to a weather API to show a 8 day range of the weather in Stafford. It shows the date, temperature and a description of the weather that day, along with an image.

### Fonts

I have used the Google Fonts library to make the text on my page visually appealing.

@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Bebas+Neue&display=swap');

-   Bebas - This was a striking font, which is easy on the eye also. I did not want anything that applied to a specific target audience (nothing too childish or playful). This font will appeal to all that use the site, and wont take away anything from the content of the page.


### Color

![color_theme](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64138643/87045675-106b4a00-c1f0-11ea-8c87-82c5c3c3fa2a.PNG)

I chose this color theme as it tied in well with the colors of Stafford. Many of the iconic buildings of stafford are old Tudor houses, and are painted balck and white. As well as this, the two main sports teams in Stafford, Stafford Rugby Club and Stafford Rangers FC play in yellow/black and white/black respectively. 

### Images 
The Jumbotron image of Mill Street was 

The icons on the weather section were taken from [weatherbit](https://www.weatherbit.io/api) - These were then linked to weather code in the API data.

## Technologies Used

- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)  This was used to create the structure of the site.

- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) This was used to make the page more visually appealing.

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) This project used Bootstrap as a framework. The main use of this will be for the layout and grid of the page.

- [Google-Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) I have used range of fonts from Google to make the page more visually appealing.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com) This was used for the mobile menu in the navbar.

- [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) This was used to create the HTML and CSS for the site.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/) This was used for hosting and version control of the website. From here, I also used the Code Institute template to begin the coding of my site.

## Testing

How does the site work compared to your user stories.

## Project Reviews
### Project Review 1

- In my inital project review, I discussed my project idea of having a what to do in my Hometown of Stafford and a weather report feature also. My mentor said this would be a good idea to base my project on.

### Project Review 2

- In my second project review, we discussed the project development so far. I was pleased to hear it all looked / worked okay, with some improvements to be made. These included: 
Reducing the color scheme, I went from having a equal variation of orange, black and white, to just having black / white with a hint of orange.
A fixed nav bar - as page was very long to have to scroll all the way back up to the top, especially on mobile.
Correct formatting of my scripts / HTML/

These changes have been implemented and the whole page updated to give a better design of the page to make it more user friendly.
